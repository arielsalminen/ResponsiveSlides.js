# ResponsiveSlides.js v1.21
### Simple & lightweight responsive slideshow plugin (in 1kb)



[ResponsiveSlides.js](http://responsive-slides.viljamis.com/) is a tiny jQuery plugin that creates a responsive slideshow using images inside &lt;ul>. It works with wide range of browsers including all IE versions from IE6 and up. It also adds css max-width support for IE6 and other browsers that don't natively support it. Only dependency is [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and that all the images are same size.

Biggest difference to other responsive slideshow plugins is the file size (907 bytes minified and gzipped) + that this one doesn't try to do everything. ResponsiveSlides.js has basically only two different modes: Either it just automatically fades the images, or operates as a responsive image container with pagination and/or navigation to fade between slides.



Usage Instructions and demo
======

For instructions and demo go to [http://responsive-slides.viljamis.com](http://responsive-slides.viljamis.com/), or [download this repository as a zip file](https://github.com/viljamis/ResponsiveSlides.js/zipball/master) and and open "index.html" from the "example" folder. There's also a file called "themes.html" inside the "themes" folder which has [more examples about the usage](http://viljamis.com/responsive-slides/themes/).

Currently only jQuery 1.7 and up is supported.
